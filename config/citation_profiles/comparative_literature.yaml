# --- Reference Type Distribution ---
# Target percentage ranges for each reference type in a well-balanced bibliography.
# These are soft targets; the system should flag significant deviations, not enforce rigidly.
reference_type_distribution:
  primary_literary:
    target_pct: [20, 40]
    description: >
      Literary works, testimonial texts, musical scores, early modern primary sources --
      the objects of analysis. Always directly quoted, never merely paraphrased.
      In CL, primary texts span multiple national traditions and languages.
    observed_range: "19-45% across sample articles"
  secondary_criticism:
    target_pct: [25, 45]
    description: >
      Scholarly articles and monographs that analyze the primary texts or their tradition.
      Includes philology, literary history, and specialized criticism. Usually paraphrased
      with selective short quotation of key formulations.
    observed_range: "35-41% across sample articles"
  theory:
    target_pct: [8, 25]
    description: >
      Philosophy, critical theory, and cross-disciplinary theoretical frameworks
      (e.g., Derrida, Foucault, Spivak, Shklovsky, Kermode). Deployed surgically
      for specific concepts, not engaged in exhaustive exegesis unless theory IS the
      primary object of close reading.
    observed_range: "8-34% (higher when theory is the primary object)"
  methodology:
    target_pct: [0, 10]
    description: >
      Works cited primarily for their methodological contribution (e.g., McKenzie
      on bibliography, Parry/Lord on oral-formulaic theory, quantitative metrics).
      Often overlaps with theory; classify here only when the method itself is the
      point of citation.
    observed_range: "0-15%"
  historical_context:
    target_pct: [0, 15]
    description: >
      Historical, social science, legal, and political sources that provide context
      for the argument without being objects of literary analysis. Includes legal
      documents, historical monographs, biographical sources.
    observed_range: "0-21%"
  reference_work:
    target_pct: [0, 5]
    description: >
      Encyclopedias, dictionaries, bibliographic tools. Cited in footnotes for
      specialist readers, not in body text.
    observed_range: "0-9%"
  self_citation:
    target_pct: [0, 8]
    description: >
      Author's own prior work. Should be functionally integral (prior study that
      the current paper extends), not gratuitous. 1-3 entries typical.
    observed_range: "0-12% (typically 1-5 entries)"

# --- Bibliography Size ---
bibliography:
  target_entries: [35, 60]
  observed_range: "40-77 entries across sample articles"
  median_observed: 47
  notes: >
    CL articles tend toward compact bibliographies with deep engagement per source.
    A 35-entry bibliography with sustained engagement is preferable to 70 entries
    with superficial coverage.

# --- Citation Density ---
citation_density:
  avg_citations_per_page: [3.0, 5.5]
  observed_range: "2.75-6.5 across sample articles"
  median_observed: 4.3
  density_pattern: >
    Citation density is NOT uniform. Typical pattern:
    - Introduction: moderate (framing references)
    - Scholarly engagement / historiographic sections: HIGHEST density
    - Close reading sections: LOW density (primary text only)
    - Conclusion: LOW to MINIMAL (author's own synthesis)
    Peterson and Maslov show an alternating rhythm; Sacks shows U-shaped pattern.
  section_norms:
    introduction: "moderate (3-4/page)"
    theoretical_framing: "high (5-7/page)"
    close_reading: "low (1-3/page, primarily primary text references)"
    conclusion: "minimal (0-2/page)"

# --- Quotation Patterns ---
quotation:
  overall_ratio: >
    Direct quotation dominates over paraphrase. CL articles typically use
    quotation for 40-85% of source engagement. Paraphrase without any embedded
    quoted terms is rare (<10% of source engagement in most articles).
  what_to_quote:
    primary_texts: "ALWAYS directly quoted. The reader must see the actual words."
    key_theoretical_formulations: >
      Specific terms and phrases from theorists are quoted when the precise
      language matters philosophically or analytically. Examples: Loseff's
      'Aesopian language,' Derrida's 'absolute singularity,' Cru's 'choice of
      the small.'
    secondary_criticism: >
      Mostly paraphrased, but memorable formulations and specific claims to be
      interrogated are quoted. Quote when you intend to analyze or contest the
      exact phrasing.
    historical_context: "Paraphrased. Quoted only for striking formulations."
  what_to_paraphrase:
    - "General scholarly arguments and positions"
    - "Historical background and context"
    - "Factual claims from secondary sources"
    - "Arguments you endorse without needing to analyze the wording"
  quote_lengths:
    short_phrase: "1-8 words -- most common; key terms, scare-quoted concepts"
    sentence: "9-35 words -- important propositions and claims"
    block_quote: >
      35+ words, indented. Reserved for:
      (a) primary literary texts that are objects of close reading,
      (b) programmatically important statements from theorists,
      (c) passages the argument will analyze word by word.
      Typical: 2-14 block quotes per article.
  block_quotes:
    target_count: [2, 10]
    observed_range: "2-21 across sample articles"
    primary_text_dominance: >
      Block quotes from primary literary texts outnumber those from
      secondary/theoretical sources by roughly 3:1.

# --- Quotation Introduction Strategies ---
quote_introduction:
  common_verbs:
    - "writes"
    - "argues"
    - "notes"
    - "observes"
    - "suggests"
    - "points out"
    - "contends"
    - "insists"
    - "describes"
    - "explains"
    - "declares"
    - "cautions"
    - "recalls"
  framing_patterns:
    - "As [Author] writes in [Work], ..."
    - "According to [Author], ..."
    - "[Author] has argued that ..."
    - "In [Author]'s formulation, ..."
    - "What [Author] calls '[term]'"
    - "[Author] goes further: ..."
  advanced_techniques:
    secondary_citation: >
      'qtd. in' (MLA) for quoting through a mediating source. Common when
      accessing primary witnesses through a critical anthology.
    delayed_attribution: >
      Withholding the author's name until after the quotation for rhetorical
      effect (see Peterson on Derrida). Rare but powerful.
    subjunctive_hedging: >
      'might be heard as,' 'can be read as,' 'perhaps' -- models interpretive
      openness rather than definitive claims (see Larson).
    echo_chaining: >
      Placing quotations from different authors side by side to demonstrate
      intertextual echoes (see Larson on Shalamov/Pushkin/Blok).

# --- Multilingual Handling ---
multilingual:
  expectation: >
    CL expects engagement with sources in multiple languages. All 6 sample
    articles cite works in 2-6 languages. Monolingual bibliographies signal
    insufficient comparative engagement.
  minimum_languages: 2
  typical_languages: 3
  handling_rules:
    primary_text_quotations: >
      Quote in the original language FIRST, then provide English translation.
      For block quotes: original-language block followed by translation block.
      For inline quotes: original in quotation marks, translation in parentheses
      separated by semicolon.
    secondary_criticism: >
      Non-English secondary sources are cited in the original language in the
      bibliography. In-text discussion is in the article's language.
    technical_terms: >
      Specialized terms from non-English scholarly traditions (e.g., Russian
      Formalist terms, French prosodic terms) may be used inline without
      translation if they are internationally recognized in the field.
    translation_attribution: >
      State translation policy in a footnote: 'All translations are my own
      unless otherwise noted.' Mark modified translations: '(translation modified).'
  observed_languages:
    - "English, French, Spanish, Russian, German, Latin, Italian, Arabic, Armenian, Greek, Polish"

# --- Footnote Conventions ---
footnotes:
  target_count: [8, 20]
  observed_range: "8-20 across sample articles"
  median_observed: 14
  character: >
    Footnotes in CL are SUBSTANTIVE, not mere reference pointers. They contain:
    (a) bibliographic guidance clusters ('See X; as well as Y'),
    (b) extended scholarly arguments that would interrupt the main text,
    (c) additional quotations and cross-references,
    (d) philological/textual notes and translation clarifications,
    (e) methodological caveats and qualifications.
    A typical footnote is 40-150 words. Some function as mini-essays.
  functions:
    bibliographic_guidance: >
      Clusters of 'See...' references directing specialist readers to further
      reading without interrupting the argument. Most common function.
    substantive_discussion: >
      Extended arguments, qualifications, or comparative observations that
      enrich but are not essential to the main argument.
    translation_notes: >
      Clarification of translation choices, attribution of translations,
      provision of original-language text.
    acknowledgments: >
      Thanks for manuscript access, conference feedback, or research support.
      Typically in footnote 1 or an unnumbered acknowledgment note.

# --- Citation Format ---
citation_format:
  system: "Chicago/MLA hybrid"
  description: >
    Comparative Literature uses a hybrid system: parenthetical author-page
    citations (MLA-style, no year) in the body text, combined with substantive
    footnotes (Chicago-style). Works Cited at the end, formatted alphabetically.
  in_text:
    single_work: "(Author Page)"
    disambiguation: "(Author, Short Title Page)"
    multiple_sources: "(Author1 Pages; Author2 Pages)"
    secondary_citation: "(qtd. in Author, Work Page)"
    page_only: "(Page) -- when author and work are clear from context"
    no_year: true
  bibliography:
    title: "Works Cited"
    arrangement: "alphabetical by author surname"
    format: "Chicago/Turabian with MLA conventions"
    non_english_titles: "given in original language; translations in parentheses for non-Latin scripts"
    multiple_works_same_author: "separate full entries (no em-dash shorthand in most cases)"

# --- Structural Conventions ---
structure:
  literature_review: >
    NO separate literature review section. References are woven continuously
    into the argument. Citation serves the argument, not the other way around.
  conclusion_citations: >
    The conclusion is typically citation-light or citation-free, allowing the
    author's own synthesis to stand on its own authority.
  no_abstract: >
    CL articles typically begin immediately with text or epigraphs rather than
    abstracts.
  section_headings: >
    Varied: some articles use titled sections, others use numbered sections
    without titles, and some use no sections at all.

# --- Reference Selection Principles ---
# Distilled from cross-paper analysis of source selection strategies.
selection_principles:
  - name: "deep_engagement_over_breadth"
    description: >
      A compact bibliography with sustained engagement per source is valued over
      an extensive bibliography with superficial coverage. 35-50 deeply engaged
      sources preferred over 70+ lightly cited ones.
  - name: "primary_text_privilege"
    description: >
      Primary literary/artistic texts are privileged as evidence. Arguments are
      built on close reading of actual texts, not summaries of other scholars'
      readings.
  - name: "scholarly_genealogy"
    description: >
      The canonical scholarly genealogy for the topic must be represented.
      Foundational scholars are engaged at length, not merely cited.
  - name: "multilingual_competence"
    description: >
      The bibliography should demonstrate engagement with scholarship in the
      languages of the field, not just Anglophone criticism. Monolingual
      bibliographies are a red flag.
  - name: "interdisciplinary_reach"
    description: >
      CL expects crossing disciplinary boundaries -- philology, musicology,
      book history, performance studies, political theory, postcolonial studies,
      translation studies, etc.
  - name: "theory_surgical_not_exhaustive"
    description: >
      Theory is deployed for specific concepts and vocabulary, not engaged in
      exhaustive exegesis (unless theory itself is the object of close reading).
      Each theoretical source should contribute a concrete analytical tool.
  - name: "recent_scholarship_present"
    description: >
      30-50% of entries should be from the last 15-20 years, demonstrating
      currency. But foundational older works are equally essential.
  - name: "every_source_actively_engaged"
    description: >
      No decorative or background citations. Every cited work should contribute
      a term, phrase, argument, or piece of evidence that is actively taken up
      in the text.
  - name: "self_citation_calibrated"
    description: >
      1-3 self-citations integrated naturally, providing relevant prior work
      on related topics. Not self-promotional.

# --- Author Positioning Conventions ---
positioning:
  modes:
    - name: "sympathetic_extension"
      description: "Takes a framework and extends it into a new domain"
      frequency: "most common"
    - name: "dialectical_synthesis"
      description: "Positions between opposing scholarly camps, constructing a third way"
      frequency: "common"
    - name: "immanent_critique"
      description: "Reads an author against themselves through close attention to their own language"
      frequency: "common"
    - name: "continuator"
      description: "Presents work as extending an established research tradition"
      frequency: "common (especially in philological articles)"
    - name: "corrective"
      description: "Gentle correction of prior claims, often with new evidence"
      frequency: "occasional"
  tone: >
    CL favors scholarly generosity and precision over polemics. Even disagreement
    is typically framed through careful reading rather than dismissal. 'X is wrong'
    is rare; 'X's language reveals...' or 'the evidence now suggests...' is
    preferred.
