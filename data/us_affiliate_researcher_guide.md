### 研究计划（为 Haun Saussy 定制）

**Title: Decadent Translations: The Circulation of *Fin-de-Siècle* Aesthetics Between France and China, 1895–1937**

Dear Professor Saussy,

I write to inquire about the possibility of a Visiting Scholar appointment at the University of Chicago under your sponsorship.

Your *Translation as Citation: Zhuangzi Inside Out* fundamentally reshaped my understanding of how Chinese philosophical traditions mediate the reception of European literature — particularly your analysis of Xu Zhimo's encounter with Baudelaire's *Les Fleurs du mal* through the lens of Zhuangzi's citational logic. My proposed project extends this inquiry by examining not translation as an isolated act, but the broader **economy of decadent aesthetics** circulating between Paris and Shanghai at the turn of the twentieth century.

**The Project.** My doctoral thesis (Sorbonne Université, 638 pp.) examined the parallel emergence of decadent literary sensibilities in France and China during the fin de siècle. Building on that foundation, the proposed research investigates how specific **aesthetic categories** — ennui, artifice, the cult of sensation, the hostility toward nature — traveled between the two literary systems through multiple vectors: direct translation (Baudelaire, Huysmans, Wilde into Chinese), indirect mediation (via Japanese adaptors like Tanizaki and Nagai Kafū), and autonomous invention (the late-Qing "Mandarin Duck and Butterfly" fiction that developed decadent tropes independently of European influence).

The project asks: **Was decadence translatable?** Your work shows that "translation as citation" operates not by reproducing content but by embedding foreign texts within the host tradition's own discursive framework. I propose that Chinese decadence — from the "unrestrained talent" (*kuangshi caizi*) tradition through Zhou Zuoren's aestheticism to the Shanghai modernists — constitutes precisely such a citational practice, one where Baudelairean *spleen* is refracted through a pre-existing Chinese discourse of disenchantment (*youhuan yishi*) that stretches from Qu Yuan to Cao Xueqin. David Wang's concept of "repressed modernities" in *Fin-de-Siècle Splendor* captures the Chinese side of this dynamic; your theory of citational translation captures the mechanism by which the two traditions encounter each other.

**Why Chicago.** The University of Chicago is the ideal environment for this research for three specific reasons. First, your own work provides the theoretical framework — the citational model — that I seek to extend from a single text (Zhuangzi/Baudelaire) to an entire aesthetic movement. Second, Professor Françoise Meltzer's *Seeing Double: Baudelaire's Modernity* offers the complementary French-side expertise on Baudelaire's modernity that my project requires. Third, the CNRS-UChicago HumanitiesPlus International Research Laboratory provides an institutional bridge to French academic networks that would facilitate archival collaboration with Parisian colleagues.

**Proposed duration:** One academic year (September 2027 – June 2028), self-funded through [external fellowship / personal funds].

I hold a PhD in Comparative Literature from Sorbonne Université and have published in *Babel* (2024). I would be honored to discuss this project further at your convenience.

### 研究计划（为 David Der-wei Wang 定制）

**Title: Repressed Decadences: Rethinking *Fin-de-Siècle* Literary Modernity Across the Franco-Chinese Divide**

Dear Professor Wang,

Your *Fin-de-Siècle Splendor* has been a foundational text for my research since the earliest stages of my doctoral work at Sorbonne Université. The concept of "repressed modernities" — the argument that late-Qing fiction was developing its own forms of literary modernity in complex, non-derivative relation to European developments — opened the possibility of studying Chinese and French fin-de-siècle literatures not as "original" and "copy," but as **parallel, partially entangled experiments in decadent modernity**.

**The Project.** My dissertation examined the aesthetics of decadence at the Franco-Chinese intersection during the 1890s–1930s. The proposed research takes this further by systematically mapping what I call **"repressed decadences"** — moments where Chinese literary modernization suppressed, displaced, or transfigured its own decadent impulses under the pressure of nationalist utility (*wenyi weigong*).

I am particularly interested in the **asymmetry** between French and Chinese receptions of decadence. In France, Huysmans's *À rebours* (1884) became a manifesto; decadence was proudly claimed as an aesthetic program. In China, the same period's "Mandarin Duck and Butterfly" fiction (*yuanyang hudie pai*) was retrospectively **repressed** — dismissed by May Fourth reformers as feudal escapism — even though its sensibility (ornament, sensation, ennui, erotic melancholy) closely parallels French decadent aesthetics. Your insight that Chinese literary modernity was "repressed" rather than "absent" applies with particular force here: what was repressed was not modernity *tout court*, but specifically the **decadent variant** of modernity.

The project proposes three case studies:
1. **Wu Jianren's "Strange Events" and Huysmans's** ***À rebours***: catalogues of sensation in a collapsing imperial order
2. **Su Manshu's romantic melancholy and Baudelairean** ***spleen***: self-fashioning as the decadent monk-poet
3. **Eileen Chang (Zhang Ailing) and Colette**: female authorship within and against the decadent tradition

**Why Harvard.** Beyond the unparalleled fit with your own research, the Harvard-Yenching Library's Chinese rare book collections and the Widener Library's French literature holdings together constitute the ideal archival environment for this comparative project. I would also welcome the opportunity to engage with the broader intellectual community around *A New Literary History of Modern China* and the ongoing conversations at the Fairbank Center.

### 研究计划（为 Jing Tsu 定制）

**Title: The Aesthetics of Failure: Decadence as Counter-Narrative in Franco-Chinese Literary Modernity**

Dear Professor Tsu,

Your *Failure, Nationalism, and Literature* demonstrated how the experience of failure — military defeat, diplomatic humiliation, cultural crisis — became a generative force in Chinese literary modernity during precisely the period (1895–1937) that my own research addresses. I propose a project that brings this insight into conversation with the French fin-de-siècle tradition, where **failure, exhaustion, and decline were not merely political experiences but constituted the very aesthetic program of literary decadence**.

**The Project.** At the heart of both French decadence and Chinese late-Qing/early-Republican literature lies a paradox: the aesthetic valorization of what national ideology condemns. French decadent writers (Baudelaire, Huysmans, Rachilde) embraced artifice, sterility, and exhaustion as aesthetic virtues — in direct opposition to the Third Republic's ideology of regeneration and *revanche*. Chinese writers of the same period (Lin Shu, Su Manshu, the *yuanyang hudie pai*) cultivated a comparable aesthetics of refined melancholy and sensory excess, even as the dominant discourse demanded national strengthening (*qiangguo*) and the literature of utility (*wenyi weigong*).

My project, "The Aesthetics of Failure," examines this **structural homology** between French decadent aesthetics and Chinese late-imperial literary sensibility, arguing that both represent what I term **counter-narratives of modernity** — literary programs that resist the modernizing state's demand for productive, purposeful cultural labor. I am interested not in direct influence (though it exists, via translation), but in the **parallel logic** by which two literary cultures, facing analogous crises of imperial collapse and national reinvention, generated strikingly similar aesthetic responses.

Your concept of failure as constitutive of Chinese modernity provides the theoretical key. Where nationalists saw decadence as a symptom of Chinese weakness to be overcome, literary decadence — both in France and China — revalued failure itself as a form of aesthetic knowledge, a mode of perception unavailable to the progressive optimism of modernizing ideology.

**Why Yale.** Your expertise in the intersection of Chinese nationalism, language politics, and literary modernity (1895-1937) is directly aligned with the Chinese side of this project. Additionally, Professor Maurice Samuels's work on nineteenth-century French cultural modernity — he teaches "Fin-de-siècle France" covering decadence, symbolism, and naturalism — would provide the essential French-side expertise. Yale's exceptional East Asian and French collections make it an ideal research environment.

**Title: Degenerative Aesthetics East and West: Decadence, Degeneration, and the Novel in France and China**

Dear Professor Wampole,

Your *Degenerative Realism* traced a genealogy I have long sought to articulate — the continuity from nineteenth-century degeneration discourse (Nordau, Lombroso, Morel) through fin-de-siècle decadent aesthetics to the contemporary French novel. The book's demonstration that Houellebecq, Beigbeder, and Bellanger inherit not merely the realist *form* but the degenerationist *worldview* of Zola and his contemporaries opens a question I would like to pursue in a comparative Franco-Chinese framework.

**The Project.** "Degenerative Aesthetics East and West" examines how the **degeneration paradigm** — the idea that civilizations, like biological organisms, undergo cycles of flourishing and decline — traveled between France and China at the turn of the twentieth century, and how it was metabolized differently by the literary cultures of each nation.

In France, degeneration theory produced decadence as an **aesthetic program**: writers embraced the diagnosis of civilizational decline and made it the basis for a new kind of literary beauty (Baudelaire's *fleurs du mal*, Huysmans's *À rebours*, Rachilde's transgressive novels). In China, the same degeneration paradigm arrived via Yan Fu's translations of Herbert Spencer and Huxley in the 1890s, but was received primarily as a **political diagnosis** demanding **national regeneration** — the very opposite of the French aesthetic response. Yet beneath the nationalist surface, a parallel **aesthetics of degeneration** flourished in Chinese fiction: the late-Qing "exposure novel" (*qianzi xiaoshuo*), the "Mandarin Duck and Butterfly" school, and later the Shanghai modernists all cultivated precisely the sensory excess, moral ambiguity, and civilizational exhaustion that characterized French decadence.

The key question is: **Why did degeneration theory produce an aesthetic movement in France but a political reform movement in China — and to what extent was the Chinese aesthetic response merely "repressed" rather than absent?**

Your framework of "degenerative realism" — the idea that the degeneration paradigm is not just a historical curiosity but a **persistent structure** shaping literary production across centuries — provides the theoretical tool for this comparison. Your forthcoming work on Fénéon's *Nouvelles en trois lignes* also resonates with my interest in the micro-forms of fin-de-siècle literary culture.

**Why Princeton.** Your expertise on the degenerative tradition in French literature is precisely what the French side of this project requires. Princeton's Program in Translation and Intercultural Communication (PTIC), directed by Professor Sandra Bermann, offers an additional institutional resource for the translation-theoretical dimension of this research. The Marquand Library's art history holdings would also support my work on visual culture (Japonisme, Orientalist painting) as a vector of Franco-Chinese aesthetic exchange.

### 研究计划（为 Lydia H. Liu 定制）

**Title: Translingual Decadence: The Problem of Untranslatable Aesthetics in Franco-Chinese Literary Exchange**

Dear Professor Liu,

Your *Translingual Practice* transformed the study of Chinese literary modernity by showing that what passes for "influence" or "reception" is in fact a complex process of **translingual negotiation** — one in which the target language actively reshapes, resists, and reconfigures the source text's meanings. The concept of the "translingual" as a zone where languages and cultures collide without fully resolving into either "self" or "other" has been foundational for my own research on the Franco-Chinese literary encounter at the turn of the twentieth century.

**The Project.** "Translingual Decadence" asks: what happens when an **aesthetic category** — rather than a concept, a text, or a word — undergoes translingual practice? My doctoral work at Sorbonne Université examined the parallel emergence of literary decadence in France and China during the fin de siècle. The proposed project shifts from parallels to **transactions**, investigating how specific aesthetic values associated with French decadence — *l'ennui*, *l'artifice*, *la perversité*, *le raffinement* — were negotiated, transformed, or refused in the Chinese literary field between 1900 and 1937.

Following your framework, I argue that these aesthetic categories were not simply "translated" (borrowed) or "absent" (untranslatable), but were subjected to a specifically **translingual metabolism**. When Lin Shu "translated" (orally, through an intermediary!) Rider Haggard and Dickens, his classical Chinese *guwen* style performed what you call a "translated modernity" — but what happened to the *decadent* modernity that was simultaneously available in French? When Yu Dafu's confessional fiction channeled what appears to be Baudelairean *spleen*, was this borrowing, independent invention, or something your theory helps us name more precisely?

The project focuses on three "untranslatable" aesthetic categories:
1. ***Ennui* / 倦怠 (*juandai*)**: How a French existential-aesthetic mood was rerouted through Japanese *taida* literature before reaching Chinese writers
2. ***L'artifice* / 人工美 (*rengong mei*)**: How Huysmans's cult of the artificial clashed with Chinese naturalist aesthetics (*ziran*)
3. ***La décadence* / 颓废 (*tuifei*)**: How the Chinese neologism *tuifei* compressed degeneration theory, aesthetic decadence, and moral judgment into a single character compound

**Why Columbia.** Your concept of "translingual practice" provides the theoretical framework that this project requires — no other existing theory adequately captures the complexity of aesthetic categories crossing between French and Chinese. The Institute for Comparative Literature and Society, which you formerly directed, is the ideal institutional home for this fundamentally comparative, translingual inquiry. Columbia's strengths in both French studies (notably Professor Antoine Compagnon's expertise on *les antimodernes*) and Chinese studies make it uniquely positioned to support both sides of this research.

### 研究计划（为 Ban Wang 定制）

**Title: The Sublime and the Decadent: Two Aesthetic Paths Through Franco-Chinese Modernity**

Dear Professor Wang,

Your *The Sublime Figure of History* demonstrated that Chinese literary modernity was fundamentally shaped by a tension between aesthetic experience and political demand — between the sublime as an autonomous aesthetic category and its conscription into revolutionary narrative. My proposed project examines the **other side of this tension**: not the sublime, but **the decadent** — the aesthetic mode that Chinese modernity consistently repressed, devalued, or expelled in favor of the sublime-revolutionary.

**The Project.** I propose that the sublime and the decadent constitute **the two poles of aesthetic modernity** in the Franco-Chinese literary field, and that understanding the relationship between them requires a genuinely comparative, cross-cultural approach.

In France, the fin de siècle saw the **displacement of the sublime by the decadent** as the dominant aesthetic category. Baudelaire's famous definition of modernity as "the transient, the fleeting, the contingent" was itself a demotion of the sublime — a turn from the eternal and overwhelming to the ephemeral and artificially refined. Huysmans, Villiers de l'Isle-Adam, and the Symbolists completed this displacement: modern beauty was to be found not in grandeur but in exhaustion, not in nature but in artifice.

In China, the opposite trajectory prevailed. The **sublime was preserved** — indeed intensified — as the dominant aesthetic of literary modernity, from Liang Qichao's "new fiction" (*xin xiaoshuo*) through Lu Xun's "iron house" parable to Mao's Yan'an Talks. The decadent, meanwhile, was systematically marginalized: the *yuanyang hudie pai* was dismissed, Zhang Ailing was exiled from the canon (until your generation of scholars rehabilitated her), and aesthetic pleasure itself became suspect.

Your work provides the theoretical foundation for understanding **why** the sublime triumphed in China while the decadent triumphed in France. The "sublime figure of history" — the aestheticization of revolutionary rupture — served the political needs of Chinese modernity in a way that decadence (with its quietism, its cultivation of failure, its refusal of purpose) could not. But this victory was not total. My research recovers the **buried decadent counter-tradition** in Chinese literature and asks how it relates to, and what it borrowed from, French decadent aesthetics.

Your translation of Benjamin's *Illuminations* demonstrates precisely the kind of Franco-German-Chinese intellectual circulation that my project maps for the decadent tradition. Benjamin's own ambivalent relationship to Baudelaire — reading decadence through the lens of historical materialism — mirrors the ambivalence of Chinese intellectuals who were simultaneously drawn to and repelled by French decadent aesthetics.

**Why Stanford.** Your expertise in Chinese aesthetics and world literature, combined with Professor Joshua Landy's work on Proust, aesthetics, and literary philosophy, creates a unique intellectual environment for this project. I would also welcome the opportunity to present at the Center for East Asian Studies, where your work on cosmopolitanism and Chinese literature has opened important conversations.

### 研究计划（为 Robert Kaufman 定制）

**Title: Aesthetic Autonomy and Its Discontents: Decadence, Critical Theory, and the Franco-Chinese Problem**

Dear Professor Kaufman,

Your work on the relationship between aesthetic autonomy and political engagement — traced through the arc from Kantian aesthetics to Adorno's *Ästhetische Theorie* — addresses a theoretical problem that is central to my research on Franco-Chinese decadent literature, though approached from a different geographical and cultural angle.

**The Project.** The European discourse of aesthetic autonomy — from Kant's *Kritik der Urteilskraft* through Schiller's *Briefe über die ästhetische Erziehung* to the French *l'art pour l'art* tradition and Adorno's dialectical reformulation — was never a purely European affair. When Chinese intellectuals encountered this tradition at the turn of the twentieth century, they faced a specific and urgent version of the question your work illuminates: **Can aesthetic autonomy be defended in a context where national survival seems to demand the total mobilization of culture?**

French literary decadence represented the most radical claim for aesthetic autonomy in the nineteenth century. Gautier's preface to *Mademoiselle de Maupin*, Baudelaire's dandyism, Huysmans's cult of the artificial — all asserted the sovereign independence of aesthetic experience from moral, political, and utilitarian demands. When this tradition reached China, it met two responses:

1. **Rejection**: Liang Qichao, Chen Duxiu, and the May Fourth mainstream insisted that literature must serve national regeneration. *L'art pour l'art* was denounced as decadent escapism (*tuifei*).
2. **Appropriation**: A minority tradition — Wang Guowei, Zhou Zuoren, Zhu Guangqian — attempted to theorize Chinese aesthetic autonomy by **combining** European aesthetic philosophy (Schopenhauer, Croce, Kant) with indigenous Chinese aesthetic categories (*yi jing*, *qu wei*, *wu wo zhi jing*).

My project examines this second, minoritarian tradition and argues that it constitutes a **non-European critical theory of aesthetic autonomy** — one that anticipated Adorno's later dialectical synthesis of aesthetic autonomy and social critique. Specifically, I trace how Wang Guowei's reading of Schopenhauer through the lens of *Honglou meng* produced a theory of aesthetic experience that is structurally analogous to Adorno's concept of aesthetic negativity: art's social truth lies precisely in its refusal to be socially useful.

**Why Berkeley.** Your expertise in the Kantian-Romantic-Adornian genealogy of aesthetic autonomy provides the theoretical interlocutor this project needs. The Berkeley Program in Critical Theory, which you co-directed, offers an institutional framework for the cross-cultural theoretical dialogue at the heart of this research. Additionally, Professor Sophie Volpp's expertise in Chinese literary culture and her position as Chair of the Center for Chinese Studies would provide essential support for the Chinese-language dimensions of this work. The C.V. Starr East Asian Library's holdings are among the finest in the country.

2. **先拿到索邦 chercheur associé**——这给你一个机构身份，申请时比"independent scholar"强得多
3. **每封邮件必须个性化**——引用教授的具体著作和论点，解释你的研究如何与其对话
4. **一篇发表不算少**——*Babel* 是Benjamins出版的A类翻译学期刊，博士刚毕业有一篇很正常
5. **638页论文是亮点**——在邮件中提到，它显示研究深度和学术严肃性
6. **申请SHC External Faculty Fellowship**——如果获得，$70K+$40K housing是最慷慨的资助
