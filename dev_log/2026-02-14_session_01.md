# Session 01 - 2026-02-14

## Summary
Implemented the complete AI Academic Research Agent for Comparative Literature from scratch. All 13 modules are implemented with 57 Python files, all parsing without errors.

## What Was Built
1. **Knowledge Base** (models, SQLite DB, ChromaDB vector store)
2. **LLM Router** (LiteLLM-based task routing with fallback and cost tracking)
3. **Journal Monitor** (5 sources: Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, CrossRef, CNKI stub, RSS)
4. **Literature Indexer** (PDF parsing with PyMuPDF, multilingual embeddings, chunking)
5. **Topic Discovery** (STORM multi-perspective gap analysis, trend tracking, scoring)
6. **Research Planner** (Corrective RAG reference selection, outline generation)
7. **Writing Agent** (Self-Refine loop, close reading, citation management)
8. **Reference Verifier** (triple-verification via CrossRef/S2/OpenAlex, format checker)
9. **Self-Review** (Multi-Agent Debate with 3 reviewer agents + meta-reviewer)
10. **Journal Style Learner** (rule-based extraction + LLM analysis)
11. **Submission Manager** (formatter, cover letter, response-to-reviewers)
12. **Orchestrator** (LangGraph StateGraph with conditional routing)
13. **CLI** (Click-based with 10+ commands)

## Configuration
- 18 journals configured (8 EN, 5 ZH, 5 FR)
- 3 journal style profiles (Comparative Literature, 中国比较文学, RLC)
- 2 reviewer profiles (Comparative Literature, PMLA)
- 6 prompt templates (close reading, gap analysis, review, intro/argument/conclusion)
- LLM routing config with 11 task types

## Tests
- test_monitor.py: Database CRUD operations
- test_verifier.py: Format checking, DOI resolution
- test_writer.py: Text processing utilities

## Next Steps
- Install dependencies and run tests
- Integration testing with real API keys
- APScheduler for periodic monitoring
- Streamlit dashboard (optional)
