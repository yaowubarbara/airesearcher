{paper_summaries}

## Your Task

From your specific perspective as a {perspective}, identify research gaps by asking probing questions about:

1. **What is missing?** What topics, texts, or approaches are absent from recent scholarship?
2. **What connections are unmade?** What cross-cultural or cross-linguistic comparisons haven't been attempted?
3. **What assumptions are unchallenged?** What received wisdom in the field deserves reexamination?
4. **What methods are underused?** What methodological approaches could yield new insights?
5. **What emerging phenomena are unaddressed?** What recent cultural/literary developments lack scholarly attention?
