## Requirements

1. **Close Reading**: Include at least 1-2 sustained close reading passages (250-400 words each) analyzing specific textual moments. Quote directly from primary texts with page references. Primary literary texts must ALWAYS be directly quoted -- the reader must see the actual words.

2. **Argument Development**: Build the section's argument through analysis, not assertion. Each paragraph should advance the argument with evidence.

3. **Citation Integration**: Cite secondary sources to support, contextualize, or respond to existing scholarship. Don't just name-drop -- engage with the cited works' arguments. Follow these strategies:
   - **Direct quotation** for: primary literary passages (always), key theoretical formulations where precise language matters (e.g. Derrida's "absolute singularity," Shklovsky's "defamiliarization"), and specific claims you intend to analyze or contest.
   - **Paraphrase** for: general scholarly arguments and positions, historical background, factual claims from secondary sources, arguments you endorse without needing to analyze the exact wording.
   - **Short phrase quotation** (1-8 words) is the most common mode: embed key terms, scare-quoted concepts, and memorable formulations inline.
   - **Sentence-length quotation** (9-35 words) for important propositions and claims that warrant analysis.
   - **Block quotation** (35+ words, indented) reserved for: (a) primary literary texts that are objects of close reading, (b) programmatically important theoretical statements, (c) passages the argument will analyze word by word. Target 2-4 block quotes per section, primarily from primary texts.

4. **Introduction Verb Diversity**: Vary the verbs introducing quotations and paraphrases. Use: writes, argues, notes, observes, suggests, points out, contends, insists, describes, explains, declares, cautions, recalls. Also use advanced framing patterns:
   - "As [Author] writes in [Work], ..."
   - "In [Author]'s formulation, ..."
   - "What [Author] calls '[term]'"
   - "[Author] goes further: ..."

5. **Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and connect back to the overall thesis.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: If comparing texts across traditions, develop genuine points of comparison (not just parallel descriptions).

7. **Multilingual Quotation**: When quoting non-English primary texts, provide the original language first, then English translation. For inline quotes: "original" ("translation"). For block quotes: original block followed by italicized translation block.

8. **Footnotes**: Use 2-4 substantive footnotes per section for: bibliographic guidance clusters ("See X; as well as Y"), extended scholarly arguments that would interrupt the main text, translation clarifications, or methodological caveats.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Vague generalizations ("This text explores themes of identity")
- Summary without analysis
- Citations without engagement ("As Scholar X notes..." followed by dropping the point)
- Parallel structure without genuine comparison
- Claims without textual evidence
- Monotonous citation verbs (repeating "argues" or "states" throughout)
- Block-quoting secondary criticism unnecessarily (paraphrase it instead)
- Monolingual quotation of non-English primary texts
