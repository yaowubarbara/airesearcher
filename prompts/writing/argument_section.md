# Argument Section Writing Prompt

Write an argument section for an academic paper in comparative literature.

## Section Details
- **Section Title**: {section_title}
- **Argument**: {section_argument}
- **Primary texts to close-read**: {primary_texts}
- **Specific passages to analyze**: {passages}
- **Secondary sources**: {secondary_sources}
- **Target word count**: {word_count}

## Paper Context
- **Overall Thesis**: {thesis}
- **Previous section summary**: {previous_section_summary}
- **Next section preview**: {next_section_preview}

## Reflexion Memories
{reflexion_memories}

## Requirements

1. **Close Reading**: Include at least 1-2 sustained close reading passages (250-400 words each) analyzing specific textual moments. Quote directly from primary texts with page references.

2. **Argument Development**: Build the section's argument through analysis, not assertion. Each paragraph should advance the argument with evidence.

3. **Citation Integration**: Cite secondary sources to support, contextualize, or respond to existing scholarship. Don't just name-drop—engage with the cited works' arguments.

4. **Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions between paragraphs and connect back to the overall thesis.

5. **Comparative Analysis**: If comparing texts across traditions, develop genuine points of comparison (not just parallel descriptions).

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Vague generalizations ("This text explores themes of identity")
- Summary without analysis
- Citations without engagement ("As Scholar X notes..." followed by dropping the point)
- Parallel structure without genuine comparison
- Claims without textual evidence
