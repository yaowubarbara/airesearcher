# Conclusion Section Writing Prompt

Write the conclusion for an academic paper in comparative literature.

## Paper Details
- **Title**: {title}
- **Thesis**: {thesis}
- **Key arguments made**: {key_arguments}
- **Target Journal**: {journal}

## Requirements

1. **Synthesize, don't summarize**: Draw the threads of the argument together to show what has been demonstrated, rather than mechanically restating each section.

2. **Return to the thesis**: Show how the analysis has supported, complicated, or refined the initial thesis.

3. **Broader implications**: What does this argument mean for the field? For comparative methodology? For understanding the texts analyzed?

4. **Future directions**: Briefly gesture toward questions opened by this research (without undermining the paper's contributions).

5. **Closing**: End with a strong final thought -- potentially returning to the opening gesture or a key textual moment from the primary texts.

## Citation Strategy for Conclusions
- Citation density should be minimal to none (0-2 per page). The conclusion is the author's own synthesis; it should stand on its own authority.
- If citing at all, prefer echoing a key phrase from a primary text analyzed earlier (short quotation callback) rather than introducing new secondary sources.
- Do NOT introduce new scholars, new theoretical frameworks, or new evidence in the conclusion.
- A brief return to a primary text passage quoted earlier in the paper is effective and appropriate.

## Length
600-1000 words
