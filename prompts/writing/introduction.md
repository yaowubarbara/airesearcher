## Requirements

The introduction must:

1. **Open with a compelling entry point** -- a specific textual moment, critical debate, or cultural phenomenon that motivates the research. Avoid generic topic sentences; begin with a concrete passage, image, or scholarly problem.

2. **Establish the scholarly conversation** -- cite 5-8 key works that define the current state of the field. Weave references into the argument continuously (no separate "literature review" section). Citation density here should be moderate (3-4 per page).
   - **Paraphrase** general scholarly positions and historical context.
   - **Quote short phrases** (1-8 words) for key theoretical terms and memorable formulations.
   - **Quote full sentences** only for claims you will contest or build upon.

3. **Identify the gap** -- clearly articulate what existing scholarship has not addressed. Position yourself through one of these modes: sympathetic extension (taking a framework into a new domain), dialectical synthesis (between opposing camps), or corrective (gentle correction with new evidence).

4. **State the thesis** -- present a clear, arguable claim.

5. **Preview the argument structure** -- briefly outline how the paper proceeds.

6. **Set the comparative framework** -- if comparing across languages/traditions, justify why this comparison is productive. Signal multilingual competence through the bibliography and any non-English key terms.

7. **Include 1-2 substantive footnotes** -- for bibliographic guidance clusters directing specialist readers to further reading, or for acknowledgments and translation policy ("All translations are my own unless otherwise noted").

## Citation Strategy for Introductions
- Moderate citation density (3-4 per page)
- Vary introduction verbs: writes, argues, notes, observes, suggests, points out, contends, has argued that
- Use "As [Author] writes in [Work]" and "In [Author]'s formulation" patterns
- Mostly paraphrase secondary scholarship; quote only key formulations
- Every cited work should contribute something the argument actively takes up

## Style Guidelines
- Academic register appropriate for {journal}
- Inline citations in {citation_style} format
- 1000-1500 words
- No bullet points or lists in the prose
- Every citation must be from the provided reference list
